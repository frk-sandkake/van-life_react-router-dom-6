# VanLife & React-Router.v6


Check out the webpage:
[#VanLife -or deluxe-meringue, as netlify named it](https://deluxe-meringue-614dfd.netlify.app/)

## Key Features:
- Single Page application with ViteJS --React
- Routing & API fetch with React-Router-Dom.v6
- MockServer with MirageJS
- Website hosted by netilfy

## Project info:
This project is built by following the scrimba-course: Learning React Router 6 by Bob Ziroll. I highly recommend it! You'll find a link to the course under Resources.

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
````
